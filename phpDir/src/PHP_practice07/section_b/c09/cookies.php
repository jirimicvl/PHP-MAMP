Overall idea here is to set cookies and count the number of pages a visitor has viewed.

Step 1: Create a counter to store number of pages vistor has viwed. Create a cookie to hold 
that counter variable. 

Step 2: Increment the value of counter, as the visitor has just viewed a page.

Step 3: Use a setcookie() function to tell the browser to create or update a cookie
and also store the value from the variable in that cookie

Step 4: A new variable should hold message saying the number of pages the visitor has viewed.
e.g. "Page views: "
*/

$counter = $_COOKIE['counter'] ?? ""; // Get data
$counter = intval($counter) + 1; // increment
$message = "Dont want to think about it";
setcookie('counter', $counter);

<?php include 'includes/header.php'; ?>

<h1><?= $message ?></h1>
<p><a href="sessions.php"> Refresh this page </a> to see the page views increase</p>
<p>Page view: <?php echo $counter;?></p>

<?php include 'includes/footer.php'; ?>
